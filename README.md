# Meltdown Chance

Mod that allows users of [FacilityMeltdown](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/loaforc/FacilityMeltdown/) to set a percentage change of a meltdown happening

- set value between 0 and 100 in the mod's config (only the hosting player's configured chance is taken into account)
- select if you want a message to popup when you pick up the apparatus


> ## **ℹ️ INFO**
>Versions prior to 2.4.0 of this mod used a method to suppress meltdowns (Harmony.Unpatch()), which might not have been the most graceful way of doing things. This introduced the need to re-patch FacilityMeltdown at the end of a round, all of which may have lead to errors and oddities.\
>If this caused any problems in your game, I apologize. This is my first ever game mod.
